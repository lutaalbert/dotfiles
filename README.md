# Dotfiles

- the correct work email + ssh auth + ssh sign for git are automatically applied when working under **~/projects/work**
- ssh auth will be remembered after first use
- to remember ssh sign, you have to add it manually to the agent - `ssh-add ~/.ssh/<personal/work>-sign_ed25519`

#### TODO:

- shift + tab when suggesting files/dirs when doing cd is not working
- ctrl + r invert where the input is (from bottom to top)
- automate make zsh the default shell
- fix: ssh signing keys are not added to ssh-agent when first used
- improve README
